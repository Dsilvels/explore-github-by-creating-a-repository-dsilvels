    Hi! I am Domineece Silvels and I am a Sophomore at York University. I am 18 years old and I play basketball at the college as well.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    My favorite hobbies consist of basketball, writing, reading, going on walks, thinking, cooking, baking, talking with friends, shopping, I mean the 
    list goes on and on. I think of the ones listed if I had to choose I would choose writing because I am currently writing a book.
    My book is about love and loss and hurt and so many other minute aspects.
